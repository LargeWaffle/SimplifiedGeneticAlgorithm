# Simplified genetic algorithm in C
## Made for our LO21 "Algorithms and programming" course
LO21 project
Collaborators : SIRVENT Thomas (me) and MIRA Victor (Bell-dort)

This project consists of a simplified version of a genetic algorithm. The abstract data types "Individual" and "Population" have been respectively implemented in simple and double chained lists. It includes functions to manipulate these data types allowing to create them, to fill them, to delete them, to "breed" them but also to select and sort the population.
